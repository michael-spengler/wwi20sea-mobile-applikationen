# Software Engineering Mobile Applications

## Curriculum ideas

1. Test Driven Development - Overview, Pros & Cons <br>

2. Svelte introduction (how to use "any" js-Framework) <br>

3. Use Svelte with TDD <br>

4. CI-Pipeline via GitHub Actions <br>

5. What is Deno? <br>

6. How to use erc20 as a Backend

The approach would be to start with the abstract TDD concept and connect students' knowledge of web dev with svelte. <br>
Through that, they learn TDD on a new and innovative js-Framework and can create a basic web app. <br> Simulating a real-world project, this app gets published on any server (maybe of the professors) via GitHub Actions. <br> Talking about the problems with such CI-Pipelines and the dangers of an attacked server, we can have a look at erc20.
